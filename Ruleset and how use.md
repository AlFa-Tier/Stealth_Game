# Game Ideas

## Pathfinder e2

### Perception

All creatures have a Perception schore and some have at leate Trained Proficiency

**Perception Modifier** = WIS Mod + Proficiency

**Perception DC** = 10 + Perception Modifier

### Stealth

**Stealth DC** is used to contest Perception. = 10 + Stealth Skill Mod

Roll on the player's Turn and when others act they contest the player's Stealth DC

### Detection

In Pathfinder, the Awareness/Detection system is devided into 4 stages

- Unnoticed: the player has no idea it is nearby.
- Undetected: the player does not know where it is. May or may not know of it's presence (can be given with and without Unnoticed).While Undetected, the player does not know where the target is but knows of it's pressence and can make an attack against a DC 11 Flat Check to hit the target (made by the DM in secret) followed by a regular attack roll made by the player. While Undetected the player is flat-footed against them.
- Hidden: the player know where it is but can't see it. This means that the player is flat-footed against their attacks and requires the DC 11 Flat check.
- Oserved: the player can see it. The target may have the Concealed condition. If so the player must roll a DC 5 Flat Check before their Attack roll

### Seek Action

A perception check vs. the Stealth DC of the target. This is made by the DM **in secret** and can be obscured with magic/artifacts. Success imporves the [Detection level](#detection) (2 for a crit).

### Hide

This is used to lower the state of [Detection](#detection) of the player to hidden. This can only be done when their is Cover, or gain the concealed condition. The bonus of the cover is then added to the player Stealth Check.

The player becomes Observed by losing their cover/concealment.
Taking any action besides Sneak, Step or Hide.

Striking when hidden makes the target flat-footed but the player becomes Observed afterwards.

### Sneak

This action can be used when hidden to become undetected. This action requires moving to a new space.

the player are allowed to move at half speed and after the movement the GM rolls a Stealth Check against the Perception DC's of the nearby creatures the players are hiding from.  
The player gets instantly Observed by any creature they do not have cover/concealment with.

**While Undetected, and it is impossible for you to be observed**, a critical failure becomes a failure instead.

- Success results in you becoming Undetected
- Failure results in remaining Hidden from those you are in cover/concealment from
- Critical Failure results in becoming Observed

The same action results apply as listed at the end of [Hidden](#hide)

## Player Movement in the game

- On a critical success, the players get to move 2 tiles without detection
- On a success, the player moves without detection
- On a fail, the players move and the detection level rises by 1
- On a critical fail, the players move and the detection level rises by 2

The idea is that the players
