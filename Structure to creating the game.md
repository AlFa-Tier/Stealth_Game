# Structure to creating the game

## Options as to making the board

1. Pygame
    Pro:

    - this allows for direct interaction with the keyboard
    - more built around direct interactions

    Con:

    - This is something I would need to learn from scratch

2. TKinter
    Pro:

    - this is something I am already proficient with, and it is possible to create buttons 
    - Easy to make the UI

    Con:

    - The created Board will be hard to manage
    - More complicated interactions between player and board

## Steps to creating the Board

1. Create the Board (decided on Pygame)
2. Create the grid on the left half (potentially more)
3. Decide on graphic elements
4. Make control instructions
5. And possible click commands on the right to use with keys.
